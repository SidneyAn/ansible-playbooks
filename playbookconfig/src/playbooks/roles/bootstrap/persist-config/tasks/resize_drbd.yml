# SUB-TASKS DESCRIPTION:
#   - Resize drbd filesytems
#   - After issuing the drbdadm resize, a pause is also required prior to
#   performing the resize2fs operation.
#
#   There does not appear to be much observability into drbdadm resize
#   at /proc/drbd or drbd-overview, so a pause is introduced. The pause needed
#   to be at least 1 second as per observations in virtual and hardware labs,
#   AIO and Standard controllers.
